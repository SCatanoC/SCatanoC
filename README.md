## Hi there, I'm Santiago ðŸ‘‹
I am a Computer Engineering student at the InstituciÃ³n Universitaria de Envigado, where I also earned my degree as a Technologist in IT Systems Development. I am passionate about telecommunications, technological infrastructure, cybersecurity, and frontend development, which I am currently learning and improving.

I am focused on developing my technical and creative skills to apply them efficiently and practically in future projects.
